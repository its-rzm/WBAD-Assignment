        genreDesc:'have been around as long as the medium itself. The classification "fantasy comics" broadly encompasses illustrated books set in an other-worldly universe or involving elements or actors completely outside the realm of our reality. Fantasy has been a mainstay of fiction for centuries, but the resurgence of fantasy in fiction around the late 1930s and early 1940s, spurred by authors such as C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien likely inspired comic book producers who were experiencing an explosion of interest at the time.[1][2] Fantasy-themed books—driven by superhero comics gaining popularity through the 1960s—grew to dominate the field. In the 1990s, fantasy authors such as Neil Gaiman helped expand the fantasy comics genre to even greater heights with the critically acclaimed Sandman series.'

Whether those names are Agatha Cristie, Arthur Conan Doyle or Edgar Alan Poe it�s always a matter of personal preference.
